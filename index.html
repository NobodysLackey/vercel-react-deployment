      <h2>Is a React App a Static Site?</h2>
      <p>
        When we use the term "static", we are referring to the fact that the
        content of the website will not change unless the files are manually
        updated. The site does <em>not</em> interact with a database or involve
        any
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side" target="_blank"
          >server-side processing</a
        >. The site will simply display the same information to every user.
        Typically, static sites are faster and more secure than dynamic sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically, a React front-end is considered a static site because it
        serves pre-built files to the browser, and all necessary data is
        included within the initial load, meaning it doesn't need to query a
        database or server for every user request. The dynamic interactions are
        handled through JavaScript (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page"
          target="_blank"
          >client-side</a
        >) which manipulates the DOM elements directly in the browser, without
        needing to fetch new pages or data from a server. This results in faster
        load times and a smoother user experience.
      </p>

      <p>This also means that we can use Surge to deploy it!</p>

      <p>
        Surge specializes in deploying and hosting these types of sites, and as
        a result, is extremely light-weight and fast. The feature we love the
        most is that Surge is extremely <em>easy to use</em>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="installing-surge">Installing Surge</h2>
      <p>
        Surge is very easy to install as well. We will perform a global install
        so that you will always have Surge available to deploy your projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><em>If you have never installed Surge before...</em></b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the following command from <em>any working directory</em> in your
        terminal:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="install">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npm install --global surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Since it is global, this is an install you will only ever need to run
        <em><b>once</b></em
        >, not on a project-by-project basis.
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Up Your Surge Account</h2>
      <p>
        <b><em>If you have never signed up with Surge before...</em></b>
      </p>

      <p>In the root directory of your project, run the following command:</p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="surge-one">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        You will be prompted to set up an account with Surge in your command
        line. Go ahead and do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, you'll be asked to confirm the project path. If you are in the
        root directory of your project, this should already be correct. Just
        press <kbd class="shadow">enter</kbd> to continue.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be automatically assigned a silly (usually) randomly generated
        domain name for your site. This is ok and we can change it later. Press
        <kbd class="shadow">enter</kbd> to continue.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/surge.gif" alt="deploy" class="image gif shadow" />

      <p>
        This may or may not succeed. Don't worry. Either way, we are not done
        yet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="environment">Setting up Surge Environment Variables</h3>
      <p>
        In your front-end .env file (<b>touch .env</b> if you don't have one),
        add the following variables in <b>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</b>:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="env">
        <div class="code" id="env-block">
          <code>SURGE_LOGIN=</code>
          <code>SURGE_TOKEN=</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>SURGE_LOGIN</b> will be the email you signed up for Surge with. No
        spaces, no quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your terminal, run the following command to get your Surge Token:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="token">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npx surge token</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Paste the returned token to the above environment variable. No spaces,
        no quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Make sure to add <b>.env</b> to your <b>.gitignore</b> file. Never
          push sensitive information up to GitHub!</em
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Building Your Production App</h2>

      <p>
        Now, you need to tell Vite to build a production version of your app. If
        you intend on using a custom domain,
        <a href="#custom-domain">skip ahead</a> to that section. If not, run the
        following:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="script-one">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>vite build</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Running the <b>vite build</b> command creates a production build of our
        React App contained in a <b>/dist</b> folder. Surge will use this to
        deploy our app.
      </p>

      <h2>Deploy</h2>
      <p>
        Once this completes, you're ready to deploy with Surge. Run the
        following command:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="script-two">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npx surge --project ./dist</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Wait for this to complete. It shouldn't take long. Take note of the
        domain that Surge selects for you (usually something silly), then
        navigate to that URL in your browser to see the result! Congratulations,
        you're deployed!
      </p>

      <h2 id="custom-domain">Setting Up a Custom Domain (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        We can set up a file in your project that will remember the particular
        domain you want to use. This step is entirely optional.
      </p>

      <h3>Choose a Domain</h3>
      <p>
        First, we'll need to see that the URL you want to use is available. Open
        a browser window and navigate to any surge domain you'd like.
      </p>

      <p>The URL should follow this format:</p>

      <div class="browser shadow">
        <code> https://reactdeployment.surge.sh/ </code>
      </div>

      <p>If it's available, the URL should show this in the browser:</p>

      <img src="./images/not-found.png" alt="not-found" class="image shadow" />

      <p>
        This means that no one else has deployed a project to this URL, and that
        it is available to be used. Remember this URL for the next step.
      </p>

      <h3 id="custom-build">Creating A Custom Build Script</h3>

      <p>
        Next, we'll create a "build" script in our <b>package.json</b> that will
        perform all of the steps we need to run our deployment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add the following script <b><em>in</em></b> your
        <b>"scripts"</b> section of your <b>package.json</b> file.
      </p>

      <p>If you already have a "build" script, replace it with this:</p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="script-three">
        <div class="code">
          <code
            >"build": "vite build && npx surge --project ./dist --domain
            &lt;SURGE_URL_IN_SINGLE_QUOTES&gt;"</code
          >
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Obviously replace the <b> <> </b> in the above script with your own
        information. Pay close attention to the URL in the script above.
        <em><b>It should be in single quotes</b></em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your <em><b>Surge URL</b></em> is what will be used as the entry point
        to your app. This is what people will see, and the one you'll want to
        put on your portfolio, LinkedIn, etc.
      </p>

      <p>This script performs the following actions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Runs the <em>vite build</em> command that creates a production build
          of our React App contained in a <b>/dist</b> folder
        </li>
        <li>
          Runs the <em>surge</em> command to redeploy our app. To ensure it runs
          automatically without needing any input from us, the project directory
          and domain options are predefined.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Deploy</h2>

      <p>
        Any time you want to deploy, run the custom script you put in your
        <b>package.json</b> file. Do so from the root of your project:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="build">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npm run build</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This will run the deployment of our Vite React App to Surge.</p>

      <h2>Recap</h2>
      <p>
        In this walkthrough, you successfully deployed your Vite React app to
        Surge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any time you make changes to your project that you want reflected on
        your deployed version, just commit your changes and then run
        <b>npm run build</b> once more.
      </p>
